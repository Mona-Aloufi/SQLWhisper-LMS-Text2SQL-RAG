## üéØ Problem & Solution (Project Overview)

### The Problem

**School administrators** and **instructors** frequently need quick, complex data insights‚Äîlike "Which students in the Algebra class have submitted fewer than two assignments in the last week?"‚Äîbut they often lack the technical **SQL skills** to query the Learning Management System (LMS) database directly. This bottleneck slows down decision-making and immediate intervention.

### The Solution

**SQLWhisper** is a sophisticated, context-aware **Text-to-SQL engine** designed to bridge this gap. It converts complex natural language queries into accurate, efficient, and **privacy-preserving SQL** queries tailored for your LMS database. It achieves this by combining a **Finetuned Text2SQL model** with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system to ensure queries are contextually accurate to the specific database schema.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The SQLWhisper system is built upon four core, interconnected components that ensure accuracy, scalability, and continuous improvement.

1.  **Data Curation:** This initial phase involves generating, anonymizing, and structuring the **(NL, SQL) paired datasets** for finetuning, using your actual LMS schema and limited, safe student data.
2.  **Finetuning:** A base Large Language Model (LLM) is **finetuned** specifically on the generated Text2SQL dataset. This specializes the model to the jargon and structure of your LMS data.
3.  **RAG System (Schema Retrieval):** Before generation, the RAG system intelligently retrieves the most relevant **database schema snippets** (e.g., table names, column descriptions) to augment the prompt. This ensures the generated SQL is valid and contextually accurate for the specific query.
4.  **Governance/Learning Loop:** This critical component handles **privacy (PII filtering, sandbox environment execution)** and features a feedback mechanism. It logs failed or inaccurate queries for human review, creating new training examples for **continuous model improvement** and maintenance.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Finetuned Text2SQL Generation:** Highly specialized model optimized for the unique structure and common queries of an LMS environment.
* **Schema-Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Uses a RAG system to dynamically inject relevant database schema into the prompt, drastically reducing hallucination and improving SQL accuracy.
* **Privacy-Preserving Execution:**
    * **PII Filtering:** Sanitizes all input queries to prevent the direct use of personally identifiable information.
    * **Sandbox Environment:** All generated SQL is executed within a secure, read-only sandbox to prevent data modification and ensure safety before the results are returned.
* **Learning Loop for Continuous Improvement:** A systematic feedback and retraining loop ensures the model's performance constantly improves as new, complex, or failed queries are encountered and corrected.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Use Cases

SQLWhisper is designed to significantly boost data accessibility for non-technical users, but the underlying Text-to-SQL technology is broadly applicable.

* **Helping School Admins:** Quickly query high-level student information, enrollment trends, or teacher workload data (e.g., "Show me the count of unique students enrolled across all history courses this semester").
* **Helping Instructors:** Instantly access specific student learning data and performance metrics (e.g., "Find all students in my Physics 101 class who have a submission grade below 70% on the last quiz").
* **Generalizability:** The core Text2SQL engine can be readily adapted to many other organizational data use cases beyond the LMS.
